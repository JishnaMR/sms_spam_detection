# SMS Spam Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to accurately classify SMS messages as either "Spam" or "Not Spam," aiding in filtering unwanted messages. Using a labeled dataset of SMS texts, I implemented a Logistic Regression model to effectively distinguish spam messages based on text features.

Data Preprocessing: Performed essential text cleaning steps, such as removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, and tokenizing, to prepare data for efficient model training.

Feature Extraction with TF-IDF: Applied Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to convert text data into numerical format, capturing the relevance of words for spam detection.

Model Training and Evaluation: Trained a Logistic Regression classifier and evaluated its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, achieving reliable spam detection.

Implementation in Google Colab: Utilized Google Colab for seamless experimentation and model development, providing a cloud-based, easily accessible environment.
